 # Data Analyst Nanodegree 
 ## Project Name : Explore Weather Trends 

## Overview :
In this project I have analyzed Global average temperature with Varanasi, India. The dataset I used has been taken from Udacity Portal in which global average temperature and city temperature average data is provided.
I extracted the data in .csv format and then I imported into Google Sheets to analyze.

## Goals:
<ol>
<li>Get the data by writing SQL query and then extract it in .csv format from Udacity portal to analyze.</li>
<li> Open the CSV file in any tool for making charts. I used Google Sheets.</li>
<li> Calculate moving average for drawing smooth graphs. I used a 10 year moving average starting from 1913.</li>
<li>Create a line chart.</li>
<li> Make observations based on the chart.</li>
</ol>

## Questions to be asked: 
<ol>
<li> How do the changes in Varanasi temperature over time compare to the changes in the global average?</li>
<li> Is Varanasi hotter or cooler when compared to global temperature?</li>
<li> What is the correlation between both?</li>
<li>What does the overall trend look like?</li>
</ol>
