 # Data Analyst Nanodegree 
 ## Project Name : Explore Weather Trends 

## Overview :
In this project I have analyzed Global average temperature with Varanasi, India. The dataset I used has been taken from Udacity Portal in which global average temperature and city temperature average data is provided.
I extracted the data in .csv format and then I imported into Google Sheets to analyze.

## Goals:
1: Get the data by writing SQL query and then extract it in .csv format from Udacity portal to analyze.
2: Open the CSV file in any tool for making charts. I used Google Sheets.
3: Calculate moving average for drawing smooth graphs. I used a 10 year moving average starting from 1913.
4: Create a line chart.
5: Make observations based on the chart.

## Questions to be asked: 
1: How do the changes in Varanasi temperature over time compare to the changes in the global average?
2: Is Varanasi hotter or cooler when compared to global temperature?
3: What is the correlation between both?
4: What does the overall trend look like?
